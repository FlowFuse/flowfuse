# Contributing to FlowForge

Before raising an issue or pull-request, please take a moment to read through
this guide to help ensure everything is done properly.

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug fixes, documentation
improvements and new features.

However if you would like to contribute a new feature or other significant item,
please raise an issue first. That gives us a chance to discuss the idea, make
sure it fits with the goals of the project and that we don't waste your or our time.

## Bug Reports

Please ensure you use the Bug Report template when raising the issue - and provide
as much information as you can.

The perfect bug report is one that provides clear and concise steps to reproduce
the issue and information on what versions of node and FlowForge you are using.

## Set up Development Environment

Details of how to up a local development environment can be found
