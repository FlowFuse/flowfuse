    text:
`Hello

Your FlowFuse Instance "{{{ name }}}" in Team "{{{ teamName.text }}}" has crashed due to an out of memory error.

This can occur for a number of reasons including:
- incorrect instance size for your workload
- an issue in your flows or functions holding onto memory
- an issue in a third-party library or node

Possible solutions:
- try selecting a larger instance type
- try disabling some nodes to see if the problem settles down after a restart
- when polling external services, ensure you are not polling too frequently as this may cause backpressure leading to memory exhaustion
- check your flows for large data structures being held in memory, particularly in context
- check the issue tracker of your contrib nodes
