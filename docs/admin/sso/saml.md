# Configuring SAML based Single Sign-On

_This feature is only available on FlowFuse Cloud and self-hosted Enterprise licensed instances of FlowFuse._

The SSO Configurations are managed by the platform Administrator under the
`Admin Settings > Settings > SSO` section.

To fully configure SAML SSO, you will need to generate a configuration in FlowFuse,
provide some of the generated values to your Identity Provider, and copy back some
values they provide.

## Configuring SSO on FlowFuse Cloud

Configuring SSO on FlowFuse Cloud requires co-ordinating tasks between the customer and
FlowFuse Cloud administrators.

**All changes must be made via a Change Request in the CloudProject repository - even if you are actioning it directly.**

When a customer requests SSO to be setup for their users, we require the following information:

1. Confirm the customer's entitlement for SSO enablement. It is only available to *Enterprise* tier customers.
1. The email domain that will be covered by the configuration. Note that each SSO configuration can only be applied to a single domain. If a customer has multiple domains, each one will require its own SSO configuration. [Issue #5011](https://github.com/FlowFuse/flowfuse/issues/5011) has been raised to make this more flexible in the future.
2. Whether it is SAML or LDAP based SSO
3. What Identify Provider they are using for their SSO.

Once this information has been provided, create a Change Request issue in the CloudProject repository recording this information.

We can then create a draft SSO configuration in the Admin/Settings/SSO section. The configuration should not be marked as active yet.

From the draft configuration, the values of `ACS URL` and `Entity ID / Issuer` can be given to the customer. These values will be required by their Identify Provider. Refer to the provider-specific documentation for how those values get applied.

In return, the customer then needs to provide:

1. `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL`
2. `Identity Provider Issuer ID / URL`
3. `X.509 Certificate Public Key`

Again, refer to the provider-specific documentation for where to find these values as each provider has its own terminology.

These values should be applied to the draft SSO configuration in FlowFuse Cloud. The configuration can then be marked as active.

It is recommended to do this final step whilst on a call with the customer so they can test the setup in real time.

### Common Issues

Aside from navigating the mismatched terminology between services providers, the most common issue we hit is where a login attempt fails and 'Invalid Document Signature' is shown in FlowFuse logs. This is because we expect both the SAML Assertions and Responses to be signed by the public certificate. The default configuration for many providers is to only sign the assertions - check the provider-specific documentation for the appropriate option to enable to address this.

## Configuring SSO

The following instructions give more details information on how to setup SSO.

### Create a SSO Configuration

1. Click 'Create SSO Configuration' to create a new config

   ![](./images/create-sso-config.png)

2. Give the configuration a name to help identify it, and provide the email domain
   name this configuration should apply to. Ensure the SAML option is selected - this
   cannot be changed after the configuration is created.

3. Click 'Create configuration'

   At this point, the configuration has been created and metadata generated for the
   configuration, but it is not active.

4. Copy the `ACS URL` and `Entity ID / Issuer` values as you will need to configure
   your Identity Provider with these values.

You can save the configuration at any time by clicking the `Update configuration`
button. The configuration will only be enabled when you tick the `active` checkbox
and save the changes.


### Configure your Identify Provider

Every Identity Provider uses slightly different terminology and varies what
information they require and what they provide. This can make it a tricky task
to complete.

We provide specific guides for the providers we have verified below.

If you have a working configuration for a provider not listed here, please do
share the details so we can add them to the list.

The general points are:

1. Your Identity Provider will supply you with some of the following values that
   should be entered into your FlowFuse SAML SSO Configuration:

    - `Single Sign-On URL` - also referred to as 'SAML Endpoint', 'Login URL' or 'IdP SSO URL'.
    - `Issuer ID / URL`
    - `X.509 Certification Public Key` - the public key of a certificate used to sign
      SAML requests.

2. Configure the `NameID` SAML option to be `EmailAddress` and have it return the email
   of the user logging in. This is how FlowFuse will verify they are a known user
   on the platform.


### Enable your SAML SSO Configuration

Once you have setup both sides of the configuration you can enable it for use
by ticking the `active` checkbox and clicking `Update configuration`.

## Creating new users

With FlowFuse 2.7, the SSO Configuration now includes an option to automatically
register users who sign in via the configuration.

This option is not enabled by default, but can be enabled but selecting the `Allow Provisioning of New Users on first login`
option in the SOO configuration.

When creating the user, the platform will use information provided by the SAML provider
to create the username. The user will be directed to their settings page where they
can modify their user details to their preferred values.

##Â Managing Team Membership with SAML Groups

Some SAML providers allow user group information to be shared as part of the sign-in process.
When properly configured, this can be used to manage what FlowFuse teams a user has access to.

To enable this option, select the `Manage roles using group assertions` in the SSO configuration.

The following configuration options should then be set:

 - `Group Assertion Name` - this is used to identify the group membership information in the response
   sent by the Identity Provider. It defaults to `ff-roles` but can be customised if the Identify Provider
   requires it.
 - `Team Scope` - this determines what teams can be managed using this configuration. There are two options:
     - `Apply to all teams` - this will allow the SAML groups to manage all teams on the platform. This is
       suitable for a self-hosted installation of FlowFuse with a single SSO configuration for all users on
       the platform.
     - `Apply to selected teams` - this will restrict what teams can be managed to the provided list. This
       is suitable for shared-tenancy platforms with multiple SSO configurations for different groups of users,
       such as FlowFuse Cloud.
       When this option is selected, an additional option is available - `Allow users to be in other teams`. This
       will allow users who sign-in via this SSO configuration to be members of teams not in the list above.
       Their membership of those teams will not be managed by the SSO groups.
       If that option is disabled, then the user will be removed from any teams not in the list above.

### SAML Groups configuration

A user's team membership is managed by what groups they are in. When the user logs in, the SAML provider
must be configured to provide a list of groups they are a member of as a SAML assertion.

The group name is used to identify a team, using its slug property, and the user's role in the team.
The name must take the form `ff-<team>-<role>`. For example, the group `ff-development-owner` will
container the owners of the team `development`.

The valid roles for a user in a team are:
 - `owner`
 - `member`
 - `viewer`
 - `dashboard`

*Note*: this uses the team slug property to identify the team. This has been chosen to simplify managing
the groups in the SAML Provider - rather than using the team's id. However, a team's slug can be changed
by a team owner. Doing so will break the link between the group and the team membership - so should only
be done with care.

An optional prefix and suffix can be include in the group name to support SAML providers that have existing naming policies. The SSO configuration can be configured with the lengths of these values so they will be stripped off before the group name is validated.

For example, if an organisation requires all groups to begin with `acme-org-`, a prefix length of `9` can be set and the group `acme-org-ff-development-owner` will be handled as `ff-development-owner`.
## Managing Admin users

The SSO Configuration can be configured to managed the admin users of the platform by enabling the
`Manage Admin roles using group assertions` option. Once enabled, the name of a group can be provided
that will be used to identify whether a user is an admin or not.

**Note:* the platform will refuse to remove the admin flag from a user if they are the only admin
on the platform. It is *strongly* recommended to have an admin user on the system that is not
managed via SSO to ensure continued access in case of any issues with the SSO provider.

## Providers

The following is a non-exhaustive list of the providers that are known to work
with FlowFuse SAML SSO.

 - [Microsoft Entra](#microsoft-entra)
 - [Google Workspace](#google-workspace)
 - [OneLogin](#onelogin)
 - [Okta](#okta)
 - [Keycloak](#keycloak)

### Microsoft Entra

Microsoft provide a guide for creating a custom SAML Application [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal).

The following tables map the Entra terminology to the FlowFuse settings.

FlowFuse Setting | Entra Setting
----|----
`ACS URL` | `Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)`
`Identity Provider Issuer ID / URL` | `Microsoft Entra Identifier`
`Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` | `Login URL`
`X.509 Certificate Public Key` | `Certificate (Base64)`

Follow these steps to properly configure SAML SSO for Microsoft Entra:

1. In FlowFuse:
   1. Create a draft SSO configuration in FlowFuse with the appropriate email domain
2. In Entra:
   1. Create a SAML application - use the guide linked above for more information
   2. Copy the following values from the FlowFuse SSO configuration into the corresponding Entra configuration:
      1. Set `Reply URL` to the value of `ACS URL`
      2. Set `Identifier (Entity ID)` to the value of `Entity ID/Issuer`
   3. Within the `SAML Signing Certificate` configuration, the `Signing Option` must be set to `Sign SAML response and assertion`.
   4. The `Unique User Identifier (Name ID)` claim must be configured to return the value of the `user.mail` source attribute.
   5. Download the `Federation Metadata XML` file from the `SAML Certificates` section of the Entra application.
3. In FlowFuse:
   1. From the metadata XML file, copy the follow properties into the FlowFuse SSO configuration:
      1. Set `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` to the value of the `Location` attribute of the `<SingleSignOnService>` tag. This should look like `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<app-id>/saml2`.
      2. Set `Identity Provider Issuer ID / URL` to the value of the `entityID` attribute of the `<EntityDescriptor>` tag. This should look like `https://sts.windows.net/<app-id>/`
      3. Set `X.509 Certificate Public Key` to the value of the `<ds:X509Certificate>` tag. This does *not* need to have the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/-----END CERTIFICATE-----` wrapper.


#### Group Membership Configuration

By default, when enabled, Entra will share group assertions under the name `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups` and provides the groups as a list of object ids.

Either the `Group Assertion Name` should be set to this name, or Entra configured to use a custom
assertion name that matches the FlowFuse SSO Configuration value.

Entra must also be configured to return group names rather than object ids.

### Google Workspace

Google provide a guide for creating a custom SAML Application [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519?hl=en).

Google Workspace only supports HTTPS-based SSO URLs. You cannot use it when developing
locally using `http://localhost:3000`.

The following table maps the Google Workspace terminology to the FlowFuse settings.

FlowFuse Setting | Google Workspace Setting
----|----
`Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` | `SSO URL`
`Identity Provider Issuer ID / URL` | `Entity ID`
`X.509 Certificate Public Key` | `Certificate`

Within the `Service provider details` configuration, the `Signed response` option must be enabled.

### OneLogin

Follow [this guide](https://onelogin.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=93f95543db109700d5505eea4b96198f) 
to create a `OneLogin SAML Test Connector`.

FlowFuse Setting | OneLogin Setting
----|----
`Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` | `SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)`
`Identity Provider Issuer ID / URL` | `Issuer URL`
`X.509 Certificate Public Key` | `X.509 Certificate`

### Okta

Within your Okta Admin dashboard, browse the App Integration catalog and add a new
instance of the `SAML Service Provider` integration.


On the Sign-On Options section, ensure SAML 2.0 is selected. Below that section
you will see a notice saying:

> SAML 2.0 in not configured until you complete the setup instructions.

Click the 'View setup instructions' button to open the page in a new window.

Follow the instructions on that - copying the `Identity Provider Issuer`,
`Identity Provider HTTP POST URL` and `Identity Provider Certificate` values
into the FlowFuse SSO configuration.

Back on the Okta SAML Application configuration page, under the `Advanced Sign-on Settings`
section enter the `Assertion Consumer Service URL` and `Service Provider Entity Id`
from the FlowFuse SSO configuration.

Under `Credential Details` section, change the Application username format to `Email`.

#### Group Membership Configuration

To configure Okta to return Group assertions, edit the Settings of the SAML Service Provider's
SAML 2.0 configuration. Expand the 'Attributes' section and add a `Group Attribute Statement`.

The name must match the `Group Assertion Name` in the FlowFuse SSO configuration (default: `ff-roles`).
You can optionally add a filter of `ff-` so that it only returns groups used by FlowFuse.


### Keycloak

Within your Keycloak Admin Console, create a new Client with the following settings:

Under the General Settings:
 - Set `Client type` to `SAML`
 - Set the `Client ID` to the `Entity ID / Issuer` value from the FlowFuse SSO configuration.

Under the Login Settings:
 - Set `Valid redirect URIs` to the `ACS URL` value from the FlowFuse SSO configuration.

Once created and you are shown the full client configuration, make the following additional changes:
 - Set `Name ID format` to `email`
 - Under the 'Keys' tab, turn off `Client signature required`

Save the changes.

Next, select the 'Download adapter config' option under the 'Action' dropdown menu. Select the
'Mod Auth Mellon files' format and click Download.

This will download a zip file. Extract the zip and open the `idp-metadata.xml` file in a text editor.

The final task is to copy some of the contents of the XML file into the FlowFuse SSO configuration.

 - Copy the value of the `entityID` attribute into the `Identity Provider Issuer ID / URL` property
 - Find one of the `md:SingleSignOnService` tags and copy the value of its `Location` attribute into the `Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL` property
 - Copy the contents of the `ds:X509Certificate` tag into the `X.509 Certificate Public Key` property

#### Group Membership Configuration

In Keycloak and the Realm setup with FlowFuse as a client:

 - Create a new "Client Scope"
 - Give it a name and ensure the "Protocol" is `SAML`
 - After saving the scope, select the "Mappers" tab
 - "Add mapper" and pick "By configuration"
 - Select "Group list" from the options
 - Give it a name and set "Group attribute name" to `ff-roles` (this must match the value configured in FlowFuse, default 'ff-roles')
 - Ensure that "Full group path" is unchecked
 - Save and return to the "Clients" list and select your FlowFuse Client created earlier
 - Under "Client scopes", use the "Add client scope" button to add the new scope
