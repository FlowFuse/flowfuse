# Kubernetes Install

This version of the FlowForge platform is intended for running in the Kubernetes (sometimes referred to as K8s)
Container management system. Typically suited for large on premise deployments or deployment in Cloud infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

### Kubectl

To manage a Kubernetes cluster you will need a copy of the `kubectl` utility. Instructions on 
how to install it can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
### Helm

FlowForge uses a Helm Chart to manage deployment. Installation can be done
through the instructions on [their website](https://helm.sh).

### Kubernetes

You will need a Kubernetes environment. The deployment has currently been tested on the following environments:

 - [AWS EKS](aws.md)
 - [Digital Ocean](digital-ocean.md)
 - MicroK8s

 It should run on any Kubernetes platform, but may require some changes for vendor specific Ingress setup.

 By default the Helm chart assumes that the Kubernetes cluster has at least 2 nodes:

 - One used to run the FlowForge management infrastructure
 - One or more used to run the Node-RED Project instances

You can run a small scale Proof-of-Concept on a single node cluster, details of how to do this can be found in the [Configure FlowForge](#configure-flowforge) section below. 

### PostgreSQL Database

The Helm chart can either install a dedicated PostgreSQL database into the same K8s 
cluster or can configure the install to use an external instance.

### DNS

A wildcard DNS entry will be needed to point to the domain that is used for the 
project instances. This will need to point to the K8s Ingress controller.

For example if you want projects to be access able as [project-name].example.com 
you will need to ensure that `*.example.com` is mapped to the IP address used by 
your Kubernetes clusters's Ingress controller.

By default the FlowForge application will be mapped to `forge.example.com` assuming
that you set the domain to `example.com`.

Notes on how to setup DNS can be found [here](../dns-setup.md).

### Email

Some features require the ability to send email to users. This can be currently be provided by:

- SMTP server
- AWS SES

## Installing FlowForge

### Download

```bash
helm repo add flowforge https://flowforge.github.io/helm`
helm repo update
```

### Configure FlowForge

All the initial configuration is handled by the Helm chart. This is done by creating a `customization.yml` file in the `helm` directory that will be passed to the helm along with the chart.

This is the minimal configuration

```yaml
forge:
  entryPoint: forge.example.com
  domain: example.com
  https: false
  localPostgresql: true
```

When running on AWS EKS and using AWS SES for email (The IAMRole needs to have the required permissions to use SES) it would look something like:

```yaml
forge:
  entryPoint: forge.example.com
  domain: example.com
  cloudProvider: aws
  aws:
    IAMRole: arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:role/flowforge_service_account_role
  email:
    ses:
      region: eu-west-1
```

A more detailed example for running on AWS can be found [here](aws.md)

As mentioned earlier the Helm chart defaults to expecting at least 2 nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

You will need to label at least one node to run the management application and one to run the Node-RED Projects.

You can do this with the `kubectl` utility. The following command lists 
all the nodes in the cluster

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You can then use `kubectl label node` to add the required labels:

FlowForge management node(s)
```bash
kubectl label node <management node name> role=management
```
Node-RED projects node(s)
```bash
kubectl label node <projects node name> role=projects
```

To override this you can remove the node selectors with the following which will mean that all pods can run on any nodes.

```yaml
forge:
  projectSelector:
  managementSelector:
```

A full list of all the configurable values can be found in the [Helm Chart README](https://github.com/flowforge/helm/blob/main/helm/flowforge/README.md).

The install can then be started with the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade --atomic --install flowforge flowforge/flowforge -f customization.yml
```

### Enabling the MQTT broker

To enable the MQTT broker with Kubernetes install you need to add the following to the `customization.yml` file

```yaml
forge:
  broker:
    url: mqtt://forge:1883
```

The `forge.broker.public_url` value will be generated by prepending `ws://mqtt` to the supplied `forge.domain` value.

## First Run Setup

The first time you access the platform in your browser, it will take you through
creating an administrator for the platform and other configuration options.

For more information, follow [this guide](../first-run.md).

Once you have finished setting up the admin user there are some Kubernetes specific items to consider.


### Using FlowForge File Storage

FlowForge projects when running in Kubernetes do not have direct 
access to a persistent file system to store files.

We recommend disabling the Node-RED core file nodes in the FlowForge
Template.

Adding `10-file.js,23-watch.js` to the list of "Excluded nodes by filename" section will ensure that the core file nodes are not loaded by the project.

FlowForge File Nodes provide a solution to this for basic read/write.
More details can be found [here](../file-storage/).



## Upgrade

- Download and unpack the latest version of the helm chart zip.
- Check the [README.md](https://github.com/flowforge/helm/blob/main/helm/flowforge/README.md) for any new options to configure in `customization.yml`
- Run the `helm upgrade --install flowforge flowforge -f customization.yml`
