# Quick Start Guide: Device Agent

This guide will walk you through the process of adding a device to FlowFuse, connecting it to the platform, and deploying your Node-RED flows remotely. FlowFuse's Device Agent helps unlock the power of your devices by allowing you to manage and deploy Node-RED flows running on those devices securely and remotely.

## Setup & Installation

### Step 1: Install Device Agent (On Device)

NodeJS version 18 is supported but version 20 or later is recommended. However, if necessary, device agent version 2.8 does support NodeJS versions 14 and 16.

For full install instructions, follow the [install instructions here](/docs/device-agent/install.md).

#### Linux/MacOS

```bash
sudo npm install -g @flowfuse/device-agent
```

#### Windows

Issue the below command in an elevated command prompt:

```bash
npm install -g @flowfuse/device-agent
```

### Step 2: Register a Remote Instance (On FlowFuse)

1. Open your web browser and go to your FlowFuse application page.
2. Navigate to the **Remote Instances** section.
3. Click **Add Remote Instance.**
4. Fill in the **Name** & **Type** and select an **Application**

5. Click **Add**
6. You will be presented with a **Device Configuration** that you will need in the next step. _(Do not close this window just yet.)_

### Step 3: Connect the Device (On Device)

1. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt on the Device.
2. Paste the command presented when you registered your Device, and run it.

### Step 4: Start the Device Agent (On Device)

1. Start the Device Agent using the command instructed by the device agent output e.g:

   ```bash
   flowfuse-device-agent
   ```

Your device is now connected to FlowFuse and ready to be used.

## Deploy Flows to Remote Instances

There are two approaches to deploying flows to your Remote Instances.

- **Developer Mode**: This mode allows you to edit and deploy flows directly from the FlowFuse platform.
- **DevOps Pipelines**: FlowFuse provides [DevOps Pipelines](/docs/user/devops-pipelines.md) as a way of pushing flows from one Hosted Instance/Remote Instance to another (or several in the case of [Device Groups](/docs/user/device-groups.md)). This is the recommended approach if you're pushing from development environments (e.g. remote test instances) out to remote production instances.

### Developer Mode

1. Navigate to **Applications** and select the application your device was added to.
2. Go to the **Remote Instances** tab within the application.
3. Locate your newly added device and **click** on your remote instance.
4. Then Click **Developer Mode** toggle button on upper right.

5. This will enable editor access for your device.

6. Clicking **Device Editor** will launch the editor.

### DevOps Pipelines

To work with Pipelines, you need at least one other Hosted Instance or Remote Device to push _from_/_to_. You can follow the instructions on setting up a Pipeline and deploying your flows between Hosted Instances/Remote Instances [DevOps Pipelines](/docs/user/devops-pipelines.md).

## Next Steps

Now you have a device connected to the platform, there are many features you can use to manage and monitor your Remote Instances.
Here are a few to get you started:

* [Snapshots](../user/snapshots.md)
* [Pipelines](../user/devops-pipelines.md)
* [Environment Variables](../user/envvar.md)
* [Logs](../user/logs.md)
