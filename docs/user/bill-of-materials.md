# Bill of Materials

Our platform now includes an Application Bill of Materials (BoM), providing a comprehensive overview of all instance dependencies associated with each application. This feature empowers you to monitor, manage, and analyze the full range of components your applications rely on, ensuring better visibility and control over dependencies.

The Bill of Materials is located within the Dependencies tab of each application, making it easy to access and review at any time.
