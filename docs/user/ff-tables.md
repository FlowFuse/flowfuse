# FlowFuse Tables

From FlowFuse v2.20.0 Teams (Pro & Enterprise teams on FlowFuse Cloud) can create a relational database to use to store data.

You can create a database by selecting the Tables entry in the left hand menu

Once you have created a database you can use the wizard to create some tables. The wizard offers a subset of the most used column types and has the option to set default values and generate sequences for ids.

Once the tables have data in them then the first 10 rows will be displayed in the Explorer tab.

## Query Nodes

FlowFuse Node-RED instances come with a Query Node that will be enabled if running in a Team with a FlowFuse Tables database enabled. This node will automatically import the required credentials to connect to the database.
