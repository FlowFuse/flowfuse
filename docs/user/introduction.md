# Getting Started with FlowFuse

This guide will help you learn how to use the FlowFuse platform to quickly create new Node-RED applications after a successful [installation](/docs/install/introduction.md) or [sign-up](https://app.flowforge.com/account/create) for FlowFuse Cloud.

## Creating a Node-RED Instance

1. **Automatic Creation**: Your first Node-RED instance should be automatically created upon your initial login to FlowFuse. To access the Node-RED Editor, simply click on `Open Editor`.

2. **Additional Instance**: For utilizing various other FlowFuse features (e.g., DevOps Pipelines), it's highly beneficial to create a second Node-RED instance. A second Node-RED instance is included in both our Starter Tier and the Trial Phase of FlowFuse Cloud. To do so, select your application— in our example, "Demo's Application"— and click `Add Instance`.

3. **Blueprint selection**: When creating a new Node-RED instance, you have the option to choose a blueprint tailored for specific use cases. For example, our "ANDON Operator Terminal" blueprint can be selected, and it will automatically configure the Node-RED instance, sparing you the need to start from scratch. While these templates are powerful out-of-the-box, they're also fully customizable, allowing you to tweak them to suit your unique requirements. Ultimately, blueprints speed up the learning curve for new users and expedite the solution-building process for experienced ones.

NOTE: _Some blueprints may only be available on certain tiers_

## Creating Your First Flow

FlowFuse published an [eBook on Node-RED development](https://flowfuse.com/ebooks/beginner-guide-to-a-professional-nodered/), which is a great resources when you're new
to Node-RED. You can also read our [blog post on creating your first flow](https://flowfuse.com/blog/2023/01/getting-started-with-node-red/).

## Creating Your First DevOps Pipeline

DevOps Pipelines enable you to link multiple Node-RED instances together in a deployment pipeline.

1. **Add a Pipeline**: Select your application and click `Add Pipeline`.

2. **Name Your Pipeline**: Enter a suitable name.

3. **Add Stages**: You can now add stages to your pipeline. In our example, we add a Development Stage and a Production Stage.

4. **Execute the Pipeline**: It is now easy to execute the pipeline with one click, promoting your recently created flow to your Production Node-RED instance.
